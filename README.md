# KMCng Application

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/kaltura-ng/kmc-ng.png)](https://gitter.im/kaltura-ng/kmc-ng)


> Kaltura Management Console HTML5 based application (a.k.a KMCng). Should replace the existing [KMC flash based application](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmc/kmc).
  
KMCng application uses the following technologies and conventions:
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to manage the application (dev)ops.
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) language (superset of Javascript).
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as our dependency management.
* Stylesheets with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).
* Best practices in file and application organization for [Angular 2]({https://angular.io/).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [x] Ensure you have [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/), version 7.0.0 or above. 
- [x] Ensure you have [git installed](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) 
- [x] Ensure you have [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (we use it for node package management) 

### Get the sources
> KKC-ng solution is comprised of many packages; The KMC-ng application is developed along-side the [kaltura-ng](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng) packages and [mc-theme](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng-mc-theme) package. To simplify local development we created a tool that automagically bind them together as-if they where part of the same repository.

You have two development options as described below.

#### Option I (the blue pill) - Develop kmc-ng application
Use this option if you want to get this app running fast and you don't care working with a code few days older.
  
  > If you want to later create a pull request you should use the second option.

```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/kaltura/kmc-ng.git 

# change directory to your app
$ cd kmc-ng

# install the dependencies
$ yarn

# checkout latest standalone code
$ yarn run checkout-standalone

# sync dependencies to the new branch
$ yarn

# run a local server
$ yarn start
```

#### Option II (the red pill)- Develop kmc-ng complete solution (multiple repos)
> In this option you will clone all the relevant repos to your machine and bind them together. Use this option to develop and create pull requests.

Please read [docs/develop kmc-ng solution guide](./docs/develop-kmc-ng-solution.md).


### Run the application
Run the following command
```
$ yarn start
```
navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.
